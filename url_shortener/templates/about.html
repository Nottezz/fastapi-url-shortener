        <p>
            <strong>FastAPI URL Shortener</strong> is a lightweight and efficient service
            that allows users to create, manage, and share short links.
            It is built with <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" target="_blank">FastAPI</a>,
            ensuring high performance and modern Pythonic design.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-5">Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            The project was created to provide a self-hosted alternative
            to commercial URL shortening platforms. It helps teams and individuals
            generate short, memorable links that can be easily shared
            in documents, messengers, or social networks.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-5">Technology Stack</h2>
        <p>
            The service is built on top of modern technologies to ensure reliability and scalability:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>FastAPI</strong> – asynchronous web framework</li>
            <li><strong>Redis</strong> – in-memory database for fast storage and caching</li>
            <li><strong>Docker</strong> – containerized environment for deployment</li>
            <li><strong>Pytest</strong> – testing framework for ensuring code quality</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mt-5">Vision</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of the project is to provide an open-source, privacy-friendly tool
            for URL shortening that you can fully control. Future plans include
            advanced analytics dashboards, integration with messaging platforms,
            and team collaboration features.
